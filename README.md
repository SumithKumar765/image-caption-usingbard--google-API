# image-caption-usingbard--google-API
In this project, I have used the Google Bard API to develop a well-designed Streamlit application that predicts captions for images uploaded by users in JPG or JPEG format. The app includes a user-friendly "Browse" option, allowing users to easily upload images. The integration of the Bard API ensures accurate and contextually relevant captions.
